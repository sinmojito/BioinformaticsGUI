    How to use:

    1. Click "Browse" next to "Count Matrix File" to provide a count matrix file (CSV format). The file should have rows representing genes and columns representing samples. The first row should contain the sample names.
    
    2. Click "Browse" next to "Clinical Data File" to provide a clinical data file (CSV format). The file should have rows representing samples and columns representing clinical variables. The first row should contain the variable names.
    
    3. Enter the minimum total read counts in the "Min. Total Read Counts" box to filter out genes with low expression. For example, enter "10" to keep genes with at least 10 total read counts across all samples.
    
    4. Enter design factors as comma-separated values in the "Design Factors" box. Design factors are the clinical variables you want to compare. For example, if you want to compare samples based on their condition and account for batch effects, input "condition,batch". You can use any clinical variables available in your clinical data file as design factors.
    
    5. Enter the minimum log fold change value in the "Min. Log Fold Change" box. Genes with a log fold change below this threshold will not be considered significant.
    
    6. Enter the maximum p-value in the "Max. P-value" box. Genes with a p-value above this threshold will not be considered significant.
    
    7. Click "Run PyDESeq2" to perform the differential expression analysis. The results will be displayed in a new window.

    File formats:

    Count matrix file (CSV):
        Rows represent genes, and columns represent samples. The first row should contain sample names.
        Example:
            Sample1,Sample2,Sample3
            Gene1,10,20,30
            Gene2,50,60,70

    Clinical data file (CSV):
        Rows represent samples, and columns represent clinical variables. The first row should contain variable names.
        Example:
            Sample,Condition,Batch
            Sample1,Control,1
            Sample2,Treated,1
            Sample3,Treated,2

    Example Scenarios:

    1. Suppose you are studying the effects of a drug on cancer cells. You have performed an RNA-seq experiment and obtained gene expression data for both treated and untreated cancer cells. Additionally, you have performed the experiment in two different labs, introducing a potential batch effect. Your count matrix file contains the gene expression data, while your clinical data file has information about the treatment conditions and the lab in which the experiment was performed. To perform differential expression analysis comparing treated and untreated samples while accounting for the batch effect, you would enter "condition,lab" in the "Design Factors" box. Enter the minimum total read counts, minimum log fold change, and maximum p-value as needed. Click "Run PyDESeq2" to view the results.

    2. Suppose you are investigating the impact of diet on gene expression in a mouse model. You have three groups of mice: one fed a high-fat diet, one fed a normal diet, and one fed a calorie-restricted diet. Furthermore, the mice are from two different genetic backgrounds. Your count matrix file contains gene expression data, and your clinical data file has information about the diet and genetic background of each mouse. To compare gene expression changes between the different diets while accounting for the genetic background, you would enter "diet,genetic background" in the "Design Factors" box. Enter the minimum total read counts, minimum log fold change, and maximum p-value as needed. Click "Run PyDESeq2" to view the results.

    3. In a study on the effects of aging on gene expression, you have samples from young and old individuals. The samples were collected at different time points, introducing a potential confounding factor. Your count matrix file contains gene expression data, while your clinical data file includes information about the age of the individuals and the time point of sample collection. To perform differential expression analysis comparing young and old individuals while accounting for the time point, you would enter "age,time_point" in the "Design Factors" box. Enter the minimum total read counts, minimum log fold change, and maximum p-value as needed. Click "Run PyDESeq2" to view the results.
